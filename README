üîç Project Overview: Cataract Detection Using YOLOv12
This project involves training and evaluating a YOLOv12 object detection model for identifying cataracts in medical images. The goal is to build an AI system that can automatically detect cataract-affected regions using labeled image data.

üß† Model Used
YOLOv12 (You Only Look Once Version 12)

Model architecture used: yolov12s.yaml

Utilizes FlashAttention for faster computation (requires Ampere GPU or newer like RTX 3090, 3080, etc.)

üì¶ Dataset
Sourced from Roboflow Universe

Project: "Cataract Finder"

Workspace ID: da-mec7y

Dataset version: v1

Format: YOLOv12-compatible (data.yaml, train/val/test image & label folders)

‚öôÔ∏è Training Configuration
Framework: Ultralytics YOLO with Hugging Face supervision

Epochs: 50

Checkpoint: yolov12s.yaml

Dataset split: train, val, and test sets as per Roboflow structure

üìä Evaluation & Performance
Evaluation Metrics:

mAP@50:95 (Mean Average Precision)

mAP@50

mAP@75

Visualization:

Confusion matrix

Annotated inference results with bounding boxes and class labels

‚úÖ Outcome
The trained YOLOv12 model successfully detects cataracts in test images.

Accuracy and performance are evaluated using mAP scores (exact values weren't printed in your code but were computed).

The model shows good generalization, visualized through test predictions and annotation overlays.
